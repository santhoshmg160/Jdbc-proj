I am very delighted and interested to share my first project using #JDBC. I learned JDBC through #Youtube videos. For my understanding, I have done a #CRUD operation using JDBC. It gave me a strength and skill to do many projects and learn more and more new concepts and technologies.

Full Form of CRUD,
                  C ->  CREATE
                  R ->  READ
                  U ->  UPDATE
                  D ->  DELETE

In this project, I used the concepts of #inheritance, #encapsulation and #getter/setter functions and used #MySQL queries; 

I posted my project working demo below:-
